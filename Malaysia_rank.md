# Benchmarking government response on Covid-19 in Malaysia vs. key countries
updated 9 Apr 2020
<p>
As Malaysia heads into its third week of Movement Restriction Order (MCO), we seek to study how the lockdown is impacting the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases and to compare various performance measures with other countries. University of Oxford is currently the leading authority in tracking government responses from from around the world in handling the crisis under its <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker">OxCGRT data repository</a>. Based on multiple responsive measures such as movement restrictions, contact tracing and testing policy, OxCGRT generates a stringency index as a measure to rank countries on how strict the government policies are, which is updated on a daily basis as new measures are introduced. 
<p>  
Below is the latest scoring for each response category for Malaysia and other countries, with the stringency index between 0 to 100 displayed next to the country name. Malaysian government responses are currently ranked rather high up in the scale with an index of 85.7, although there are more improvements to be carried out particularly in ramping up testings and formulating a more effective contact tracing procedures. The latter is particularly important when time comes for the MCO to be eased or lifted in order to avoid a second outbreak, which is successfully carried out by South Korea that was not placed under strict lockdown.
