# Evaluating the reliability of the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases reported by countries

### Working assumptions
Since different countries have different resources and policies in conducting Covid-19 tests, it may be hard to gauge the true extent of the spread of the outbreak in each country. However, deaths caused by the virus are more likely to be reported correctly as sick individuals seek medical attention, in addition to more rigorous reporting procedure in recording such cases. This is in contrast to positive cases that are more likely to be under-reported which generally excludes cases such as positive individuals who are asymptomatic and those who recovered at home without ever being tested.

### Are reported confirmed cases under-estimated?
We shall now compare the number of confirmed positive cases versus the number of deaths and calculate the regression line that estimates the relationship between the two. In the chart below, the area shaded in orange that lies below the regression line can be interpreted as countries where the official number of confirmed cases are more likely to be under-reported, particularly those that are well underneath the border between the shaded and non-shaded areas.

Based on this method, we may have reasons to believe that the number of total cases reported for Malaysia so far can be used to represent the actual situation on the ground, especially when comparing with other countries with almost similar number of deaths such as Hungary and Ukraine. However, when comparing with other comparable countries such as Norway and Australia, the number of total cases in Malaysia is on the lower side.

### Are countries testing enough?
We can also benchmark if Malaysia is testing enough by looking at how other countries are performing. Similarly as in the analysis above, we shall use the number of death to gauge the spread of the virus in the population. Using a regression line to find a relationship between the two, we can interpret that countries that lie below the line in the shaded area are more likely to be under-testing its population. South Korea and Germany that have been praised by the WHO for their testing policies, are well above the regression line. Malaysia, on the other hand, is at the lower end of this benchmark.
