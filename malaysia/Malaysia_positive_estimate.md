# Evaluating the reliability of the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases reported by countries

### Working assumptions
Since different countries have different resources and policies in conducting Covid-19 tests, it may be hard to gauge the true extent of the spread of the outbreak in each country. However, deaths caused by the virus are more likely to be reported correctly as sick individuals seek medical attention, in addition to more rigorous reporting procedure in recording such cases. This is in contrast to positive cases that are more likely to be under-reported which generally excludes cases such as positive individuals who are asymptomatic and those who recovered at home without ever being tested.

### Are reported confirmed cases under-estimated?
Based on the assumption above, we can compare the number of confirmed positive cases versus the number of deaths. In the chart below, area shaded as more likely to be under-reporting is based on countries that lie below the linear regression line when fitting latest available data points. Based on this method, we may have reasons to believe that the number of total cases reported for Malaysia so far can be used to represent the actual situation on the ground.

### Are countries testing enough?
We can also benchmark if Malaysia is testing enough by looking at how other countries are performing it. Similarly as in the analysis above, we shall use the number of death to gauge the spread of the virus in the population.
