# Covid-19 Government Response Tracker: A Dynamic Comparative Reflection of Global Performance
<p>by Dr Dhesi Raja & Khairul Omar for Young Digital Leaders

## 1. Preamble

Wide-ranging responses have been launched by countries around the world since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in their bid to minimize its toll within the shortest time possible. The enemy is unseen and its true nature unknown, with some governments either throwing all resources possible on one end of the spectrum, while others opt a more liberal approach by minimally restraining and relying upon good public literacy and trusting self-regulatory social measures.
<p>
Benchmarking governmental responses which may vary in timing and stringency as exemplified by the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) attempts to provide insights on the impacts following various state interventions. Towards the end, we shall visit various state interventions in the betterment of our understanding of how we have fared in relation to others.

## 2. Analysis of government responses by country and their impact on managing Covid-19

Our comparative analysis goes further three-fold by combining disease trends of respective nations, testing and their stringency index over the past 70 days in our attempt to provide greater width and depth of the effectiveness of respective policies implemented.
<p>
Data for the number of confirmed cases and deaths is obtained from <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/">John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre</a> while the number of tests performed is sourced from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing">Our World in Data</a>, a collaboration between University of Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development and the non-profit organization Global Change Data Lab. For countries that do not publish their cumulative testing data on a daily basis, the number of daily tests between two non-consecutive dates where data is available are shown to be spread equally across this period. We also indicated the number of tests performed as a proportion of a country's population so that the figures are comparable between different countries. 

### 2.1 South Korea
  
The number of daily cases was successfully brought to a stable base-line after an initial peak. Reciprocating was a steady increase in the number of fatalities as expected with a steady decline. South Korea had a consistent Testing Policy (TP) complemented by an automated Contact Tracing Policy (CTP), both of which decisively instituted early and uninformedly. Apart from School Closure (SC) and Public Event Closure (PEC), South Korea eluded implementing stricter social measures via lock-downs. Arguably, both policies of CTP and TP were pivotal in their success without resorting to stifling public movement nor to socio-economic activities.

### 2.2 Sweden

Sweden had from the onset opted for a sustainable policy, one which aims to attain Herd Immunity (HI) without overwhelming their healthcare services nor compromising the economy to much effect. Community suppression was avoided apart from school closure (kindergarten through grade nine were open). As with South Korea, businesses and restaurants remained opened. Social distancing was self-imposed where many abided. Public literacy of the latter being an asset to their success as was the case in South Korea. Tests were minimal as were other stringent social measures. Both the number of cases and deaths (reaching 3000 cases as of early May) have steadily declined. With a population of 10 million, Sweden leads other Nordic nations in the number of deaths. Their policy of waiting for natural immunity to develop remains, which is largely supported by the nation.

### 2.3 Singapore

Singapore had extensive tests conducted from the onset.  Similarly, as with South Korea, automated CT played an important role in containing the outbreak at the initial phase, though compounded of late by local transmissions and by the foreign worker clusters.  This is reflected by the late peaks of both cases and deaths of recent.  Noteworthy is their early decision to practice wide-spread testing and stringent automated CTP allowing early detection and decisive informed intervention.

Initially opting for HI as with Sweden, the UK made a late decision to impose stringent policies via lock-down and testing were ramped up in tandem. Clearly indecisiveness had resulted in the escalation of cases and with reciprocal deaths. The UK continues to struggle with healthcare facilities being overwhelmed with the economy tail-gaiting in the aftermath.

### 2.4 United Kingdom

Initially opting for HI as with Sweden, the UK made a late decision to impose stringent policies via lock-down and testing were ramped up in tandem. Clearly indecisiveness had resulted in the escalation of cases and with reciprocal deaths. The UK continues to struggle with healthcare facilities being overwhelmed with the economy tail-gaiting in the aftermath.

### 2.5 Malaysia

Strict public control measures were implemented in three phases from the onset. The number of official cases and deaths peaked gradually attaining an almost plateau-like crescendo with a decline following. Tests were incrementally instituted over time. Manual Contact Tracing is an on-going exercise in limiting the spread of the epidemic. The government’s recent policy in gradually retracting the Movement Control Order (MCO) and its subsequent results will be much anticipated over time both on effects on health and on the social-economic front.

University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government is currently the leading authority in tracking government responses from around the world in handling Covid-19 crisis under its <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker">Coronavirus Government Response Tracker</a> (OxCGRT) data repository. Based on a set of responsive measures imposed by each government, OxCGRT generates a stringency index as a measure to rank countries on how strict government policies are, which is updated daily.
<p>
The stringency index is calculated based on nine indicators: school closure, workplace closure, public events cancellation, gathering restrictions, public transport closure, stay-at-home requirements, internal movement restrictions and immigration restrictions. The ninth indicator is public information campaign, which is included in the stringency index calculation but not shown in our charts since this is a universal practice in all countries to date. In addition, while not part of the index calculation method, we also report on two additional key indicators: contact tracing policy and testing policy which are critical in combatting the pandemic even after a lockdown is eased.
<p>
YDL aims to provide a daily update of these benchmarking tables for which analysts and decision makers could refer in assessing how Malaysian government strategies compare with other countries on a continuous basis.

<p>
When analysing the stringency index between countries, it is best to interpret the ranking together with the breakdown of government policies, as a given country with a higher or lower stringency index than another country may not necessarily be better or worse if the underlying circumstances are not directly comparable, plus other factors that may not be explicitly indicated in this report.
<p>
Each government response indicator has a maximum raw score of either 2, 3 or 4 depending on the category, as defined in <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Calculation and presentation of the Stringency Index.pdf">OxCGRT documentation<a>. In our report, we have restated these raw scores to a normalized format between a minimum of 0 (policy not imposed) and 1 (strictest policy) so that different categories of government policies can be directly compared on the same scale.
<p>
Note that OxCGRT <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/OxCGRT. What%27s changed 24 April 2020.pdf">revised the calculation method</a> for its stringency index on 29 April 2020, which is based on the nine indicators above, for which our report here is based on. Please exercise caution when referencing other publications based on OxCGRT found elsewhere that were published prior to this date, as they may be using the former calculation method that may not comparable today. At YDL, all indices and data prior to this date have been updated to reflect the latest definition so that they are comparable across all dates.

## Timeline of government responses by category

In this section, we present the timeline of how each of the government response indicators has changed over the past 70 days by analysing each indicator at a time. This can be used to identify best practices for each category from other countries that can be learned and adopted in tackling this global crisis.
