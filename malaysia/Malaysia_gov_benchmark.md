# Benchmarking the impact of government policies on Covid-19

University of Oxfordâ€™s Blavatnik School of Government is currently the leading authority in tracking government responses from around the world in handling Covid-19 crisis under its Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) data repository. Based on a set of responsive measures imposed by each government, OxCGRT generates a stringency index as a measure to rank countries on how strict government policies are, which is updated daily.
<p>
The stringency index is calculated based on nine indicators: school closure, workplace closure, public events cancellation, gathering restrictions, public transport closure, stay-at-home requirements, internal movement restrictions and immigration restrictions. The ninth indicator is public information campaign, which is included in the stringency index calculation but not shown in our charts since this is a universal practice in all countries to date. In addition, while not part of the index calculation method, we also report on two additional key indicators: contact tracing policy and testing policy which are critical in combatting the pandemic even after a lockdown is eased.
<p>
YDL aims to provide a daily update of these benchmarking tables for which analysts and decision makers could refer in assessing how Malaysian government strategies compare with other countries on a continuous basis.

<p>
When analysing the stringency index between countries, it is best to interpret the ranking together with the breakdown of government policies, as a given country with a higher or lower stringency index than another country may not necessarily be better or worse if the underlying circumstances are not directly comparable, plus other factors that may not be explicitly indicated in this report.
<p>
Note that OxCGRT revised the calculation method for its stringency index on 29 April 2020, which is based on the nine indicators above, for which our report here is based on. Please exercise caution when referencing other publications based on OxCGRT found elsewhere that were published prior to this date, as they may be using the former calculation method that may not comparable today. At YDL, all indices and data prior to this date have been updated to reflect the latest definition so that they are comparable across all dates.

### Breakdown by country
<p>
Data for the number of confirmed cases and deaths is obtained from John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre while the number of tests performed is sourced from Our World in Data, a collaboration between University of Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development and the non-profit organization Global Change Data Lab.
<p>
Each indicator has a maximum raw score of either 2, 3 or 4 depending on the category, as defined in OxCGRT documentation. In our report, we have restated these raw scores to a normalized format between a minimum of 0 (policy not imposed) and 1 (strictest policy) so that different categories of government policies can be directly compared on the same scale.
