It looks like the testing data is probably being reported in the png infographic that pops up when you click on the ""Infographic Vietnam"" link partway down the page, but the text is too small (and the png resolution is too low) for me to see exactly what the text diacritics are so I can't get a proper translation. Either way, the number that is most likely the cumulative total is ""121,821"", which happens to be the same as the cumulative total reported on 2020-04-11, which suggests that the number has not been updated by the ministry of health (even though the infographic claims to be up-to-date as of April 13th).",121821,3014.0,1.239,0.031,3899.0,0.04

The cumulative total number that I report here (and for all days going forward unless otherwise mentioned) is from a png infographic that pops up when you click on ""infographic vietnam"" partway down the page. The ""132,771"" I extracted is the red number shown in the 2nd last gray box in a row of 5-6 gray boxes shown in the bottom third of the png. The problem is that the png is such bad resolution that I can't read the vietnamese text beside the number that appears to be the cumulative total of tests. I am fairly confident that the number I've extracted is indeed the number of cumulative tests conducted, because on April 13th the number in this spot was ""121,821"" which was equal to the April 11th cumulative total.",132771,,1.35,,,
