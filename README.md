# Covid-19 Analysis and Forecast
#### by Khairul Omar
My analysis and forecast of the Coronavirus pandemic as it happens using daily raw data released by <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">John Hopkins University</a>. For details on Python codes used in this report, please refer to the <b><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/khairulomar/Covid-19/blob/master/Covid19.ipynb?flush_cache=true">Covid19.ipynb</a></b> Jupyter notebook. Data on this site will be updated on a daily basis.

## Analysis of actual confirmed cases to date
While China still holds the most number of confirmed cases to date, the centre of the outbreak now concentrates in Europe and the United States while continues to record large number of new cases everyday.

<p>
While the total number of cases is a key indicator, it is also critical to analyse the <b>growth factor</b> or the rate at which the total number of cases increases each day. A factor close to 1.0 indicates that a plateau is about to be reached where the number of new cases would be relatively small.

<p>
From Figure 2 above, we can see can see that countries which still has a high growth rate is projected to continue to have large number of new cases. As the growth of a viral outbreak is exponential in nature, we can demonstrate how the total number of cases would continue to multiply if the latest growth rates do not start to subside.
