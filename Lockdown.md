# The impact of Covid-19 movement restrictions by key countries

### Benchmarking against China
China is the only major country that has managed to bring down the number of new cases to near-zero level. This was achieved by a strict implementation of lockdown that went beyond the level practiced in Europe and elsewhere. Lockdown was only eased 60 days after it was first imposed, at the time when the number of new cases are practically zero. In fact, near-zero level (both in terms of new cases and day-on-day growth) was achieved around 2 weeks prior to the easing of the lockdown, but the strict measures remained intact.
<p>
Based on the lessons learned from China, it would be premature for other countries to lift movement restrictions currently in place until the benchmark seen in China has been reached in order to avoid future outbreaks. While the strictest form of lockdown has been lifted in China, many other measures still remain until the government is confident that the outbreak is truly behind us.

### South Korea: containment without lockdown
South Korea managed to control its outbreak through containment and contract tracing without the need for lockdown measures. While this analysis focuses on the impact on movement restriction, it would be beneficial to study how the outbreak phases panned out in South Korea and what other countries can learn from it.
<p>
Also note that unlike China where new cases tend to hover around a single or two-digit, South Korea to date stabilizes around 100-case mark which it will continue to manage without exploding to a new peak. This may well be the outcome for other countries, which further suggests the importance of continous efforts to contain the spread and not to let our guards down when the worse seems to be behind us.
